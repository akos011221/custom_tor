# Custom Tor-like Proxy

This project is a custom Tor-like proxy designed to facilitate anonymous communication and data routing across multiple nodes. It implements a layered encryption and decryption mechanism to secure messages while routing them through intermediary nodes. The long-term objective of this project is to develop a dedicated browser tailored for this proxy system.
